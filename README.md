Andrew T. Chris G., Web Apps, Mentor: Yvonne

# Brief Description:

We will be creating a webapp that will choose exercise based off choice of muscle group for complete full body workout. It will take an input of which muscle exercises chosen and generates a random move related to that muscle group. An option will be present to check any combination of muscle groups desired. Estimated workout time is about ~30 - 60 min. If time permits, attempt to add other options.

Stage 1: Research different muscle groups and append at least five random exercises for that specified group.

Stage 2: Network pathing for the pages on the website (visualizing what goes where).

Stage 3: Begin coding exercise lists, functions, and random generator.

Stage 4: Coding approute and connecting pages.

Stage 5: CSS (make pretty).

Stage 6: Include Diagrams on how to conduct exercises.

Stage 7: Other features /  more debugging
